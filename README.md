# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is a simple showcase of various data structures and algorithms written in
C++. Fundamental knowledge of these concepts is critical for any programmer to know.

## Running

To run these algorithms, either use the compiler built in to Microsoft Visual Studio, or if
you're using a different IDE like VS Code (such as myself) you can use the Clang or GCC
compilers found [here](https://winlibs.com/).

If you need help setting up a compiler in your dev environment, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLOx1hD3_o) video has a great
explanation at the beginning for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

### Examples

Each data structure comes with its own .cpp file which includes functional examples of the
implementations found in the header files.
